# Please add protected words here in new line.
# Lines starting with hash would be ignored so you comments using this.
# I usually add current date before adding a protected word.
# Protected words: The words you'll be putting here would be ignored by the stemmer. That is, for a keyword like 'training' put here, it would be returned as 'training' by the stemmer and not 'train'.
# Blank lines would also be ignored. 
# Demo: Uncomment 'training' that I have added on Jan 10, 2019 to protect it. Likewise, you can add your words in each line.
